## Static and Dynamic Arrays
- one of the most used ds
- used as a building block for a lot of other ds
- Static array = fixed length container having n elements indexable from range [0, n-1]
- indexable is each slot can be referenced by a number
- chunk of memory is a contiguous for array
- Temporarily store objects
- used as buffers - IP streams
- Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables - because of indexing property
- return multiple values from a function, pointer to a ref to an array when you want to return more than one value as one value
- dynamic programming - cache answers or problems

- Complexity Analysis for static and dynamic arrays:
  - Access: O(1), O(1)
  - search: O(n) )(n)
  - Insertion: n/a O(n)
  - Appending: n/a O(1)
  - Deletion: n/a O(n)
- Dynamic arrays can grow and shrink as needed.
  - create with initial capacity of some static array
  - then begin adding elements to it.
